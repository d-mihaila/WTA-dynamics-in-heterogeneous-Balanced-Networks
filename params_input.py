'''File containing the input parameters for the simulation -- rate, frequency, amplitude and duration of the possonian sine input signal'''

rate = [10000.0, 10000.0] # mean firing rate of the input generator -- NOTE: should it perhaps not be the same to ensure unbiased results based on this.
amplitude = [5000.0, 7500.0]
frequency = [10.0, 20]

applied_input = 1000.0 # time of learning
