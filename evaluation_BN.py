'''This file is meant to evaluate the 'balanced nature' of the clusters'''

# we have 3 (or 4 ifwe vary clustering too) measurements for this:

# 1. Coefficient of Variation (CV) of the Inter-Spike-Interval (ISI) distribution
# 1.2 Local measure of CV for ISI
# 2. Cross-correlation of the spike trains
# 3. Excitatory-Inhibitory currents balance (short time proportionality 10ms) -- as desribed in paper "Criteria on Balance, Stability, and Excitability in Cortical Networks for Constraining Computational Models"
